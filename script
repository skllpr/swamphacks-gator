While we workout let me explain our  tech stack.
Notation uses the geolocation API to find user location and
microsoft azure
cognitive services to convert speech into text
and look for keyword leave note to leave a message
at that location by sending the request to
------------------------------------
a flask endpoint which adds data to a cockroachDB
on the cloud. CockroachDB was a nice method to save
the location of messages in a central place.
 This database then provides messages
to the user.
------------------------------------
The user can view these messages in AR through Aframes
Aframes renders the messages in the user's view when
they get close to the message. Looks like workout time
is done! On to the potato
